/**
  * A shared thread pool for making asynchronous [[Writer]]s without allocating a thread per writer.
  * The pool is created with a fixed number of threads which are used to handle write operations for
  * all writers associated to the pool.
  *
  * Writers are added to the pool using the [[pool()]] method, which returns a [[PooledWriter]] that
  * can be written to in place of the original [[Writer]].  [[Writer]]s of different types can be mixed
  * within the same pool, and each writer can specify either an unbounded queue or a fixed queue of
  * independent size when being pooled.
  *
  * [[Writer]] can be added to the pool at any time (except aftering calling [[close()]] on the pool.
  * Writers can be closed individually (and removed from the pool) using either their [[PooledWriter.close()]]
  * method which runs synchronously on the calling thread, or by using [[PooledWriter.closeAsync()]]
  * which will execute the close asynchronously and return a [[Future]] upon which `get()` must be called
  * to re-throw any exceptions that were thrown during the close operation.
  *
  * The entire pool can be closed be calling [[close()]] on the pool.  This will asynchronously
  * close all open writers, shutdown the internal thread pool, and rethrow the first exception (if
  * any) encountered when closing writers.
  *
  * @param threads the number of threads to use to write items.
